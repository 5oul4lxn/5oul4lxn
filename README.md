integrated wireless land-line forwarded via amplified speaker system with a 
duck taped  📣 megaphone - to- condensed 🎤 microphone duck taped inside the megaphone 📣 plugged into
a distortion footpedal and resynthisized via speech to text then faxed over to my assistant who then pages me on my moto pager ""that is still in 
operation since 1983 passed down from my pops to me so they can let me know dinners ready, but I'll know if it's github-homeys or dinner"" then after I check the call back I will
hand write a letter and wax seal it for security purposes and tape it on my pet pidgen who's got a GPS tracker implanted suppository style for me to 
monitor the direction of my 'real live bird drone postal service provider' can't be too careful these days, whenever the GPS signal stops I will then proceed to 
file a missing pigeons report to the sheriff department at which the area code that the signal halted in once their tracking teams find my federal working pigeon 
they will then have the letter sealed in wax with no return address or destination address but only the digits of whom I'm responding to, finally once you get my return message 
call my cell 8173612174 and we can then collaborate on some mastermind materials
